# Logger System
- A flexible logging system that helps track values over time, serving as a complement to the debugger.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Completed
- Granular Control: Enable or disable each logger separately.
- Color Support: Easily distinguish logs with custom colors.
- Global Toggle: Disable all loggers at once.
- Build Stripping: Automatically excluded from the final build for zero overhead.

### ⏳ Planned (To-Do)
- None at this time.

### ❌ Out of Scope / Not Implemented
- None at this time.

## 📝 Notes
- Logger vs Debugger:
  - Logger: Best for seeing values change over time.
  - Debugger: Best for inspecting values at a specific moment (requires knowing the exact moment to break).
